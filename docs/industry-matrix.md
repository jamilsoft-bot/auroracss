# Industry Feature Matrix (Gap Map)

| Capability | Aurora (current + gaps + proposal) | MUI | Fluent UI | W3.CSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Design tokens (scales, semantic tokens, dark mode, high contrast) | **Partial.** Scales + semantics + light/dark + brand variants exist. **Missing high-contrast + component tokens.** **Priority: Critical.** Proposal: add high-contrast theme and component token aliases (button/input/overlay) derived from core scales. | Full design token system with semantic tokens and theme overrides. | Full token system with semantic layers and high-contrast support. | Limited tokens; mostly class-driven colors. |
| Typography system | **Basic.** Font families/sizes/weights/line-heights exist. **Missing semantic typography tokens and responsive scale.** **Priority: Important.** Proposal: add `typography.semantic` (display/title/body/caption) and responsive clamps. | Full typography scales and variants. | Full typography styles and ramps. | Basic font sizing utilities. |
| Spacing + layout/grid | **Partial.** Spacing scale + container + stack utilities. **Missing grid system + responsive helpers.** **Priority: Important.** Proposal: add responsive grid utilities and layout tokens. | Grid utilities and responsive spacing helpers. | Fluent layout primitives and responsive breakpoints. | Responsive grid system and layout utilities. |
| Utilities strategy | **Light.** Minimal utilities in core + utils package. **Priority: Important.** Proposal: expand utilities (flex/grid, spacing, typography, color) with naming parity. | Large utility surface via sx/system. | Fluent tokens + styling helpers. | Rich utility class library. |
| Forms + validation states | **Partial.** Inputs exist, with invalid state. **Missing full validation messaging patterns.** **Priority: Critical.** Proposal: add field wrappers, error/help text, and data-state patterns. | Comprehensive form components + validation. | Full form patterns with validation messaging. | Basic form styles + error classes. |
| Focus ring + a11y defaults | **Partial.** Focus ring exists on some components. **Priority: Critical.** Proposal: apply focus-visible, aria-disabled, and reduced-motion defaults across components. | Strong focus-visible defaults. | Strong focus-visible defaults and accessibility patterns. | Basic focus handling in CSS. |
| Core components set | **Partial.** Many core components exist, missing dropdown/menu, dialog variants, toast stack, etc. **Priority: Important.** Proposal: add menu/dropdown, dialog, pagination, progress, skeleton, and data-table enhancements. | Very complete component set. | Very complete component set. | Moderate component set. |
| Motion/reduced-motion | **Partial.** Motion tokens exist. **Missing reduced-motion defaults.** **Priority: Important.** Proposal: global `prefers-reduced-motion` handling. | Reduced-motion handling built in. | Reduced-motion + animation patterns. | Limited motion guidance. |
| Documentation + examples + versioning | **Early.** Docs are minimal. **Priority: Critical.** Proposal: document components/tokens, add usage snippets, add changelog and roadmap. | Extensive docs + versioning. | Extensive docs + versioning. | Basic docs and examples. |
| Theming (brands, density, surfaces) | **Partial.** Brand variants and light/dark exist. **Missing density + surface scales.** **Priority: Nice-to-have.** Proposal: density tokens and surface elevation scale. | Theme density + palettes. | Theme density + palettes. | Basic color themes. |
| Accessibility utilities | **Partial.** a11y guidance exists, but no helper classes. **Priority: Important.** Proposal: add visually-hidden utility and focus ring class. | Rich a11y patterns and helpers. | Rich a11y patterns and helpers. | Limited helper classes. |
